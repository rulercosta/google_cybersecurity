## General Skills
1. Communication: Understanding others’ questions or concerns and communicating information clearly to individuals with technical and non-technical knowledge will help you mitigate security issues quickly.
2. Problem solving: Proactively identifying and solving problems by recognizing attack patterns, then determining the most efficient solution to minimize risk.
3. Time management: Having a heightened sense of urgency and prioritizing tasks appropriately is essential in the cybersecurity field. Effective time management will help minimize potential damage and risk to critical assets and data. Additionally, it will be important to prioritize tasks and stay focused on the most urgent issue.
4. Growth mindset: Technology moves fast, and that's a great thing! It doesn't imply "learn it all", but it does mean that one will need to continue to learn throughout their career.
5. Diverse perspectives: Encouraging diverse perspectives and mutual respect will undoubtedly help find multiple and better solutions to security problems.

## Particular Skills
1. Programming Languages:
    
    * To automate time consuming repititive tasks
    * To search data for identifying potential threats
    * To organize and analyze information for identifying patterns related to security issues
    * e.g., Python, SQL.
2. Security Information and event management (SIEM) tools:
    
    * To help identify and analyze potential security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities more efficiently
    * To collect and analyze log data (records) of suspicious events such as unusual login behaviour
    * To support analyst's ability to monitor critical activities in an organization
    * e.g., Splunk, Rapid 7, IBM QRadar, LogRhythm, Azure Sentinel.
3. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs):
    * To monitor system activity and alerts for possible intrusions
    * To monitor networks for signs of malicious activity, like unauthorized access to network
    * e.g., OSSIM, Security Onion, logwatch, CrowdSec.
4. Threat landscape knowledge: It is vital to know the threat landscape inorder to build stronger defenses against threat actor tactics and techniques. Furthermore, security professionals are expected to be able to recognize when new types of threats emerge such as a new ransomware variant.
    * To be aware of current trends related to threat actors, malware, or threat methodologies
    * To stay up-to-date on attack trends and patterns
    * Learn more about [the modern threat landscape](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1aewCwXUZ-mGjli26ZKLNs9oHN2Fs-3rZ).
5. Incident response: Cybersecurity analysts need to be able to follow established policies and procedures to respond to incidents appropriately. For example, a security analyst might receive an alert about a possible malware attack, then follow the organization’s outlined procedures to start the incident response process. This could involve conducting an investigation to identify the root issue and establishing ways to remediate it.
