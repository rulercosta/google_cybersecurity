# What is cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availibility of information (the CIA triad of security) by protecting network, devices, people and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.

## Compliance 
Compliance is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.

## Security frameworks
Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.

## Security controls
Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong posture.

## Security posture
Security posture is an organization's ability to manage it's defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.

## Threat
Any person, group or entity that can negatively impact assets.

## Threat actor
A threat actor, or malicious attacker, is any person, group or entity which presents a security risk. This risk can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data.

## Internal threat
An internal threat can be a current or former employee, an external vendor, or a trusted partner who poses a security risk. At times, an internal threat is accidental. For example, an employee who accidentlly clicks on a malicious email link would be considered an accidental threat. Other times, the internal threat actor intentionally engages in risky activities, such as unauthorized data access.

## Network security
Network security is the practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. This includes data, services, systems, and devices that are stored in an organization.

## Cloud security
Cloud security is the process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured, or set up correctly, and access to those assets is limited to authorized users. The cloud is a network made up of a collection of servers or computers that store resource and data in remote physical locations known as data centers that can be accessed via the internet. Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.

## Programming
Programming is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. These tasks can include:

   * Automation of repititive tasks (e.g., searching a list of malicious domains)
   * Reviewing web traffic
   * Alerting suspicious activity

## Personally identifiable information (PII)
PII is any information which can be used to infer an individual's identity.

## Sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII)
SPII is a specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines.
