### There were computer viruses before there was the internet... Following is the list of 11 most infamous computer viruses and malwares from as early as the 60's to as recent as the 2010's.

# 1. Creeper virus (1971)
John von Neumann's posthumous work *Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata* (published in 1966) posited the idea of a computer code reproducing and spreading itself from one computer to another, connected to the same network.

In order to develop a proof of Neumann's concept, five later in 1971, Bob Thomas wrote *Creeper* in PDP-10 assembly language. *Creeper* was capable to reproduce itself and move from one computer to another across the ARPANET.

The infected computer would print **"I'M THE CREEPER: CATCH ME IF YOU CAN."**

Ray Tomlinson, best known for implementing the first email program, wrote a rival program called *Reaper* that spread from computer to computer eliminating *Creeper*'s code.

# 2. Brain virus (1986)
In the 70's and 80's most computers operated in isolation which is why *Creeper* wasn't so widespread; most malware attacks were carried out via floppy disks, the earliest example of which is *Elk Cloner* (created by a 15 year-old as a prank and infected Apple II computers)

Of this generation of computer viruses, *Brain* came to be known as the most important one. It was developed by two South Asian computer programmers who had a business of selling medical software. The two were brothers and they were annoyed by the fact that people all around the world were pirating their software. They created *Brain* which could infect the boot sector of pirated disks. *Brain* was mostly harmless and it included the contact information of the two brothers and an offer to disinfect the software.

# 3. Morris worm (1988)
In 1988, Robert Morris, a Cornell grad student at that time, created what would now be known as the *Morris worm*. Originally meant as a proof-of-concept and demonstration of widespread security vulnerabilities in computer systems of that time. Morris had no idea what he had unleashed upon the world. Within 24 hours of it's release, *Morris worm* had infected nearly 10% of all computers connected to the internet. With it's ability to target multiple vulnerabilities, it spread faster and further than Morris had imagined. Morris didn't anticipate that it would infect individual computers several times until they ran out of their memory. Due to this, thousands of individuals and many businesses incurred losses which ranged into millions. It's sheer impact lead to the conviction of Robert Morris under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (1986), the first of it's kind.

# 4. ILOVEYOU worm (2000)
In 2000, Onel de Guzman, aged 24 living in the Philipines, crafted his creation with straightforward criminal intent: he buit a worm that would steal other people's login credentials so he could piggyback off their accounts and pay for his dial-up service. His creation took advantage of a number of flaws in Windows 95- one of them being that Windows automatically drops the file attachment extension from the email, so people unknowingly clicking on malicious mails would not have the slightest clue that they executed a malicious program on their computer system. Guzman, who was not charged with a crime due to lack of relevant legislations in his home country at that time, is now known as the pioneer of *Social Engineering* as the worm he created was spread with emails with "ILOVEYOU" in the subject line. Guzman took advantage of the fact that people would respond to his emails thinking it is from a close friend, instead they would unleash a worm which would then siphon all their contacts information and automatically spread the email to other people, thus spreading rapidly.

# 5. Mydoom worm (2004)
The most financially damaging virus ever is the *Mydoom* worm, which adjusted for inflation caused more than $35B in damages. This record has never been topped. After being sent the victim's computer, *Mydoom* would take control over the system and email out more copies of itself. It was so efficient in it's attacks that at one point nearly a quarter of all emails sent around the world were infected by *Mydoom* at it's zenith. Although there were many speculations around that the creator of *Mydoom* was a rogue member of the **FOSS** community, nothing specific has ever been proven. There are some clues pointing to this line of thought- the worm, in addition to replicating itself over emails, used the infected computers as a botnet to launch DDoS attacks on the SCO Group (which aggresively tried to claim intellectual property rights over Linux) and Microsoft, two companies the open source community is not so fond of till this day.

# 6. Zeus trojan (2007)
*Zeus*, first spotted at the tail end of the Web 1.0 era in 2007, laid the foundations of what future malware attacks could be- it is a trojan that infects via *phishing* and *drive-by downloads* from infected website, and it acts as a vehicle of all sorts of malicious payloads. In 2011, it's source code and operating manual was leaked which helped both the security researchers and potential cyber criminals who wanted to exploit the vulnerabilities of a victim's system using it's capabilities. In 2014, it's new variant was spotted, which interposed itself between the user and their banking websites, intercepting the login credentials and bank info, thus it came to known as *"banking trojan"*.

# 7. CryptoLocker ransomware (2013)
The *Zeus* saga continues, Gameover Zeus, the controllers of one of the infected systems (botnets) by the *Zeus trojan* infected their bots with *CryptoLocker*, amongst the earliest **ransomwares**. Ransomwares like *CryptoLocker* encrypts many of the files on the victim's machine and demands a payment in cryptocurrency (usually *Bitcoin*) in order to decrypt the system and restore access. It became famous for it's rapid spread. The US DoJ and peer agencies worldwide managed to take control of the Gameover Zeus botet,and restore the files of CryptoLocker victims free of charge. However, CryptoLocker, which was spread via *phishing*, still hangs around.

# 8. Emotet trojan (2014)
*Emotnet*, another trojan which is spread via *phishing*, is a prime example of *polymorphic malware*, a software which is capable of changing it's code slightly everytime it is accessed in order to better avoid recognition by endpoint security programs like an antivirus software. Like *Zeus*, it is *Emotnet* is now used to deliver other forms of malwares like *Trickster* and *Ryuk* being the most prominent ones.

# 9. Mirai botnet (2016)
A college student who intended to make DoS attacks that would help him settle scores against other players on Minecraft, Paras Jha had no clue what his creation would unleash upon the world. The *Mirai botnet* unleashed an attack on a major DNS provider and cut-off a better part of the US-East coast from the internet for almost a day. Initially, *Mirai botnet* exploited the vulnerabilities of IoT devices like CCTV cameras (that were using the factory default passwords) ended up doing way more harm, beyong intentions and expectations of it's creator.

# 10. Petya ransomware/NotPetya wiper (2016/7)
In 2016, a low virulent ransomware, known as *Petra*, started afflicted computers. It would lock down it's victim's data by encrypting the master file table- which is used by the OS to find files. A year later, NSA's EternalBlue and EternalRomance exploits were leaked which enabled ransomwares to spread from one computer to another. At the same time, a new variant of *Petra* was spotted, in a popular Ukrainian accounting software. Dubbed as *"NotPetya"* it wrecked havoc across Ukraine, and it quickly became more troublesome when it was found out that *NotPetya* is not an ordinary *ransomware*, instead it is a *wiper*- meaning it would completely destroy victim's system even after the ransom was made, since the ransom address was randomly generated. After the succesful Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, formerly a part of Ukraine's territory, many researchers speculated that *NotPetya wiper* was created by the Russian FSB as a cyberweapon against Ukraine.

# 11. Clop ransomware (2019-Present)
*Clop* or *Cl0p* is at the forefront of **ransomware-as-a-service**, in which a specialized group of hackers work on bounties, or a part of the share in the ransomeware riches extracted from the victim. *Clop* was named as one of the top malware threats in a 2022 report. In addition to preventing victims from accessing their system's data, *Clop* allows the attackers to exfiltrate that data as well.

# Times have changed a lot... In the 2020's most cybercrimes are not the work of hobbyists and lone-wolves, but by state-actors and terror groups. Cybersecurity professionals are, thus, expected to stay up-to-date with the modern threat landscape in order to ensure the safety of data, people and organizations.
